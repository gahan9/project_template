# cluster-ops — Cluster Design & Operations (SMB → Enterprise → Exascale)

Design, build, and run compute clusters that are **correct, scalable, secure,
and cost-defensible** at any scale. This skill encodes a principal-engineer
workflow plus reference designs distilled from ACM Gordon Bell Prize systems and
the operating practices of major GPU clouds.

## Core operating principle

**Size the cluster to the workload and the tier — never over-build, never
under-provision the bottleneck.** Every design decision must trace to a
measured or estimated requirement (model size, dataset throughput, comms
pattern, availability target, budget). When a requirement is unknown, ask for
it or state the assumption explicitly — do not silently guess.

## Decision workflow

Work through these gates in order. Do not skip ahead; each gate feeds the next.

```

### 1. Classify the workload

Ask / determine the dominant pattern — it dictates everything downstream:

| Pattern | Signature | Fabric sensitivity |
|---------|-----------|--------------------|
| LLM/DL **training** | tight all-reduce/all-gather, sync SGD, long jobs | **Extreme** — needs non-blocking RDMA |
| LLM **inference/serving** | latency-bound, KV-cache, autoscale | Moderate (tensor-parallel = high) |
| Classical **HPC** (CFD, MD, weather) | MPI halo exchange, nearest-neighbor | High, topology-aware |
| **HTC** / embarrassingly parallel | independent tasks, sweeps | Low |
| **Data/ETL/analytics** | I/O-bound, shuffle | Storage + east-west network |

Key questions: model/problem size, precision (fp8/bf16/fp64), global batch,
collective pattern, job duration, SLA/availability, data volume & locality,
budget, regulatory constraints.

### 2. Pick the scale tier

See `scaling-tiers.md` for full decision tables. Summary:

| Tier | Accelerators | Fabric | Typical home | Scheduler |
|------|-------------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **T0 SMB / startup** | 1–8 | PCIe / single-node NVLink | DigitalOcean, Lambda on-demand, 1 node | Docker / none / Ray |
| **T1 Team / growth** | 8–64 | RoCEv2 / EFA / 1-click IB | Lambda 1-Click, AWS Capacity Blocks | Slurm *or* K8s |
| **T2 Enterprise** | 64–thousands | Non-blocking InfiniBand (NDR), rail-optimized | Reserved cloud / colo / CoreWeave | Slurm + K8s (SUNK), Kueue |
| **T3 Exascale / national** | 10k–100k+ | Custom (Slingshot-11, Tofu-D), dragonfly | HPE Cray EX, Fugaku-class | Slurm/Flux + multi-level ckpt |

**Rule of thumb:** move up a tier only when the current tier's bottleneck is
measured, not anticipated. Most businesses live happily at T0–T2.

### 3. Select accelerators + node shape

- Match memory capacity/bandwidth to model footprint first (HBM GB per device,
  aggregate per node). A 70B bf16 model needs ~140 GB just for weights → plan
  device count and parallelism (TP/PP/DP/FSDP) accordingly.
- Prefer **fewer, fatter nodes** to cut inter-node comms for training; prefer
  **many thin nodes** for HTC/inference horizontal scale.
- Vendor-neutral: NVIDIA (H100/H200/GB200, NVLink/NVSwitch), AMD Instinct
  (MI300X/MI325X/MI355X, Infinity Fabric — huge HBM), Intel Gaudi, Google TPU,
  AWS Trainium/Inferentia. Choose on $/effective-FLOP, HBM, software maturity
  (CUDA vs ROCm vs XLA), and supply.
- CPU:GPU ratio, NUMA locality, PCIe gen/lanes, and NIC-per-GPU (rail design)
  are as important as the GPU SKU. See `provider-patterns.md`.

### 4. Design the interconnect fabric

This is the #1 differentiator of a good vs. bad training cluster.

- **Intra-node:** NVLink/NVSwitch (NVIDIA) or Infinity Fabric (AMD) for
  full-bandwidth GPU-GPU. Verify GPUDirect RDMA / P2P is enabled.
- **Inter-node:** InfiniBand NDR (400 Gb/s) or XDR for HPC/training; RoCEv2 for
  Ethernet shops (requires PFC/ECN tuning); AWS **EFA**; HPE **Slingshot-11**;
  Fujitsu **Tofu-D** (6D mesh/torus).
- **Topology:** rail-optimized **fat-tree** (non-blocking or ≤2:1
  oversubscription) is the default for AI. **Dragonfly(+)** for very large HPC.
  **Torus/mesh** where locality-aware apps dominate.
- One NIC **per GPU** on its own rail for large training; validate with
  `nccl-tests` / `rccl-tests` (bus bandwidth) and `ib_write_bw` / OSU
  micro-benchmarks before declaring the fabric healthy.

### 5. Choose the scheduler / orchestration

See `provider-patterns.md` → "Schedulers". Quick guide:

- **Slurm** — gang scheduling, topology-aware, accounting; default for HPC/
  training and national labs (often with **Flux** or **PBS Pro** at the top end).
- **Kubernetes** — for inference, mixed/elastic, cloud-native; add **Volcano**
  or **Kueue** + **JobSet** for gang/batch, **NVIDIA GPU Operator**, MIG,
  Karpenter, and a network operator for RDMA/RoCE.
- **SUNK (Slurm-on-Kubernetes)** — CoreWeave pattern; batch training under
  Slurm semantics on a K8s substrate. Good T2 compromise.
- **Ray** — Pythonic distributed for RL/serving/data; layers on K8s or Slurm.
- **LSF / PBS Pro / HTCondor** — established enterprise/HTC estates.

### 6. Design storage + data path

- **Parallel FS** for scratch/checkpoint: Lustre, IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS),
  **WEKA**, **VAST**, BeeGFS. Object (S3/GCS/Azure Blob) for cold/data lake.
- Checkpoint I/O bandwidth must absorb a full-cluster write in ≪ job MTBF (see
  §7). Size FS bandwidth to `model_state_bytes / target_ckpt_seconds`.
- Cache/stage hot data local (NVMe) or via GPUDirect Storage. Avoid NFS for
  large-scale training scratch.

### 7. Engineer reliability + observability

At scale, **failure is the steady state.** Node MTBF × node count → cluster MTBF
drops fast; a 10k-node job may see failures hourly.

- **Multi-level / async checkpointing** (e.g., SCR-style: node-local → buddy →
  parallel FS). Checkpoint interval ≈ optimal per Young/Daly formula
  (`√(2·C·MTBF)`), where C = checkpoint cost.
- **Health checks** before and during jobs: GPU ECC, XID errors, NVLink/fabric
  link flaps, thermal, straggler detection; drain + cordon bad nodes.
- **Observability:** DCGM / amd-smi exporters → Prometheus/Grafana; Slurm/K8s
  accounting; per-job GPU util, fabric counters, power. Alert on silent data
  corruption and stragglers, not just hard downs.

### 8. Secure + govern

- Multi-tenant isolation (namespaces/partitions, network policy, MIG per-tenant),
  quotas and fair-share accounting, RBAC/SSO.
- **Secrets** via env/secret manager — never plaintext in manifests or images.
- **Licensing hygiene:** avoid GPL/AGPL/SSPL contamination in shipped tooling;
  record SPDX. Confirm dataset/model licenses.
- Supply-chain: signed images, pinned deps, minimal base images.

### 9. Cost model + build vs. rent

- Compare **on-demand vs. reserved/committed vs. spot vs. owned (colo)** on a
  3-year TCO including power, cooling, networking, staff, and utilization.
- Utilization is king: a 40%-utilized owned cluster is usually beaten by
  reserved cloud. Track **$ per useful token / per converged job**, not $/GPU-hr.
- SMB/bursty → cloud on-demand/spot. Steady high-util → reserved or owned.

### 10. Validate against a reference design

Before finalizing, check the design against the closest ACM Gordon Bell /
top-500 reference system in `reference-architectures.md` and confirm the
interconnect ratio, checkpoint strategy, and precision choices are consistent
with what has actually worked at that scale.

## Reference material (progressive disclosure)

- `scaling-tiers.md` — SMB→enterprise→exascale decision tables and archetypes.
- `provider-patterns.md` — AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda, CoreWeave, TensorWave,
  DigitalOcean, and Kubernetes best-practice building blocks + scheduler guide.
- `reference-architectures.md` — ACM Gordon Bell Prize systems (Summit,
  Frontier, Fugaku, Sunway, El Capitan, LUMI, Aurora) and the design lesson each
  teaches.
- `citations.md` — papers, standards, and vendor docs to cite and where to verify.

## Documentation & citation rules (apply to every answer and change)

1. **Doc-first, simple > complex.** Lead with the plain-language answer and,
   where it clarifies, an ASCII/[mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagram or a
   small table — not a wall of prose.
2. **Link, don't lecture.** Cite any non-obvious claim with an **inline
   hyperlink** rather than a long inline explanation.
3. **Back non-trivial claims with a credible source** — a journal/conference
   paper ([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)), a standards
   body, a book, or a recognised vendor engineering blog. For cluster-scale
   assertions, prefer the ACM [Gordon Bell Prize](https://awards.acm.org/bell)
   record and the systems' official docs (see `citations.md`).
4. **Automate the sync.** After editing this skill, run
   `python scripts/sync-skill.py` so all agent homes stay identical; ship repo
   changes with the knowledge-network `tooling/ship.py` (sync → index → signed
   commit → push → PR). Don't hand-edit generated mirrors.

## Safe operation on real clusters

When this skill drives commands against a live cluster (submitting/killing jobs,
draining nodes, editing configs):

1. **Prefer a visible/audited session.** Run write operations where the user can
   see them (shared tmux, logged terminal) — no hidden side effects.
2. **Confirm before destructive actions** (`scancel`/`bkill`/`kubectl delete`,
   `rm` on shared FS, node drain/reboot). State exactly what, why, and the blast
   radius, then ask.
3. **Dry-run first** where the tool supports it (`--dry-run`, `sbatch --test-only`,
   `kubectl ... --dry-run=server`).
4. Never exfiltrate `confidential`/`secret` data or credentials into logs.

`scripts/cluster-health-check.sh` is a read-only, multi-scheduler triage helper —
run it (or read it) to snapshot cluster health before deeper work.

## Principal-engineer review lens (apply to any design you're given)

1. Is the core design correct for the workload class and tier?
2. What is the *bottleneck* (fabric, HBM, storage BW, power)? Is it the thing
   being spent on? If not — that's the finding.
3. Can it scale one tier up without a rewrite? If not, is that acceptable?
4. Reliability & security: checkpointing, health, isolation, secrets, licensing.
5. Cost: is $/useful-result defensible vs. the rent-vs-own alternative?

Classify feedback as 🔴 **Critical** (blocks correctness/scale/security) or
🟢 **Good to have** (non-breaking optimization). Appreciate solid designs
explicitly; point to the reference architecture or provider doc for anything you
assert.
